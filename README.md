üìë Research Article: ‚ÄúThe RAG Kitchen: A Systematic Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Architectures‚Äù
Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for integrating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing hallucinations and improving factuality. This article presents a comprehensive taxonomy‚Äîdubbed the ‚ÄúRAG Kitchen‚Äù‚Äîcovering foundational, intermediate, advanced, and experimental architectures. Each approach is described with its flow, technical motivation, and application scenarios. We further analyze trade-offs in scalability, latency, interpretability, and domain adaptability.

1. Introduction
LLMs have strong generative ability but suffer from hallucination and outdated knowledge.

RAG bridges this gap by grounding responses in external data.

Early designs were simple query ‚Üí retrieval ‚Üí generation loops.

Evolved into complex agentic, adaptive, and secure workflows.

We present a complete ‚Äúmenu‚Äù of RAG methods, structured as a RAG Kitchen.

2. Foundations of RAG
2.1 Naive RAG
Flow: Query ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí Vector DB ‚Üí Retrieved docs ‚Üí LLM

Use case: Simple QA over domain corpora.

Limitation: Sensitive to embedding errors, lacks validation.

2.2 Multimodal RAG
Extends Naive RAG to images, audio, video.

Example: Clinical report generation combining medical text + imaging.

2.3 HyDE RAG
Generates ‚Äúpseudo-document‚Äù before retrieval, increasing recall.

Equation: Retrieve(Embed(Hypothetical Answer))

Effective in low-resource / sparse knowledge settings.

3. Intermediate Architectures
3.1 Corrective RAG
Adds grading and validation pipeline.

Improves reliability by rejecting or correcting poor retrievals.

3.2 Graph RAG
Constructs Knowledge Graph (KG) from retrieved text.

Allows multi-hop reasoning and entity-centric queries.

3.3 Hybrid RAG
Combines Vector DB retrieval + Graph DB context.

Balances fuzzy semantic recall with precise structured lookup.

4. Advanced Architectures
4.1 Adaptive RAG
Dynamically selects retrieval strategies.

Query analyzer decides whether single-step or multi-step retrieval is required.

4.2 Agentic RAG
Multi-agent orchestration: one agent manages other retrievers, tools, or APIs.

Enables task decomposition, specialized workflows.

5. Next-Generation Directions
5.1 Temporal / Streaming RAG
Time-aware indices, sliding-window retrieval, TTL-based storage.

Crucial for financial trading, news monitoring.

5.2 Hierarchical RAG
Multi-level retrieval ‚Üí context fusion.

Example: chunk ‚Üí section ‚Üí full paper.

5.3 Retrieval-Ensemble RAG
Combines multiple retrievers (BM25 + dense + cross-encoder).

Fusion scoring improves both recall and precision.

5.4 Tool-Augmented RAG
Augments retrieval with deterministic tools (SQL, Python execution).

Reduces hallucination by grounding in verifiable outputs.

5.5 Personalization & Secure RAG
Profiles, preferences, and access control integrated.

Privacy-preserving retrieval: encrypted vector DBs, DP-based logging.

5.6 Cross-Lingual RAG
Retrieval across multilingual corpora via aligned embeddings.

5.7 Neuro-Symbolic RAG
Combines symbolic reasoning with neural embeddings.

Suitable for scientific and legal reasoning.

5.8 Closed-loop / Feedback RAG
Uses reinforcement signals, user feedback, or self-evaluation for retriever refinement.

5.9 Explainable / Provenance RAG
Retrieves with evidence chains; outputs include provenance tracking.

Critical for regulated domains.

6. Comparative Analysis

7. Conclusion
RAG has evolved from a single ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù into a full kitchen of architectures.

The future lies in adaptive, explainable, and secure RAG systems.

Each ‚Äúdish‚Äù has trade-offs‚Äîjust like in a real kitchen, you pick the right recipe for your customer‚Äôs taste (domain & use case).
